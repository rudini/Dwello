# Test list

One behavior per red-green(-refactor) cycle. Tests drive the public CLIs only.
"pin" = characterization test that passed on first run because an earlier cycle
already produced the behavior; each pin was mutation-checked instead.

## Step 1: `tdd-step <test|red|green|refactor> [message]`

- [x] red with an assertion failure commits `red: <message>` with trailers `TDD-Phase: red` and `TDD-Exit-Code: <real exit code>`
- [x] red is refused (exit 1, no commit) when the suite passes
- [x] red is refused when the failure is an import error
- [x] red is refused when no tests ran (config)
- [x] red is refused when the failure is a syntax error (pin)
- [x] red is refused when a test errors with a non-assertion exception (pin)
- [x] red is refused when a production file changed
- [x] green is refused while any test fails
- [x] refactor is refused while any test fails
- [x] phase order: green only after red
- [x] phase order: refactor not right after red
- [x] phase order: red not right after red
- [x] test (test list) phase is refused when code changed
- [x] full cycle commits every phase with the real exit code and a clean tree (pin)
- [x] no supported test framework detected -> exit 2, no commit
- [x] unknown/missing phase -> exit 2 with usage
- [x] vitest: assertion failure is red
- [x] vitest: load error is refused as red
- [x] vitest: JS production edit is refused in red, `*.test.js` is test code
- [x] files under `tests/`, `test/`, `__tests__/` are test code
- [x] vitest: config error is refused as red (no crash)
- [x] vitest: green commits when all pass (pin)
