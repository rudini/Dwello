## Session: #916 and #917 pin R1 and S2 (Phase 2, from #723)

- [x] #916: an invoice without a category is saved while the KI is unreachable, without a KI category (`invoice-categorization.pg.test.ts`, pins kept behaviour; red with both catches of the KI call removed: 400)
- [x] #917: the session cookie is HttpOnly and SameSite, Secure with COOKIE_SECURE, which production sets (`session-cookie.test.ts`, pins kept behaviour; red with `httpOnly: false`)
- [x] Slice review round 1 (closing): `docs/reviews/i916-review-1.md`, no findings
- [x] No scenario: tests that pin kept behaviour
- [x] PR `Fixes #916`, `Fixes #917`: pushed after this archive
